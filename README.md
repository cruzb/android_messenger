# Messenger
This is my attempt to create a basic messaging application for use on Android. This application uses the Google Firebase framework as a backend. For now it supports only simple text communication with minimal UI improvements. I intend to add sign-in with google, multi-user chats, and a user friendly interface in the near future.
